A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

HEAD
DATA | next -> DATA next -> DATA next -> null
Node -> Node -> null
HEAD ------------------------------ TAIL

Bunch a nodes pointing to next one

Comparison with Arrays:

    Lists
  * Do not have indexes!
  * Connected via nodes with a next pointer
  * Random access is not allowed (we have to start from beginning,
  we cannot just access to 10th item, like an elevator.) But everything don't have to be Indexed.

    Arrays
  * Indexed in order!
  * Insertion and deletion can be expensive
  * Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
