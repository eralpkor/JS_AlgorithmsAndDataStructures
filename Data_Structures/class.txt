What is a class?

A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods.
It's like molding for car parts.

example:

class Node {
  constructor(first, last) {
    this.first = first
    this.last = last
  }
}

To create objects from this blue print:

const names = new Node('eralp', 'kor')

static method is used for every instance in a class.
For example send an email to everyone

class Students {
  constructor(first, last) {
    this.first = first
    this.last = last
  }

  fullName() {
    return `Your name is ${this.name}, ${this.last}.`
  }

  static enrollStudents(...studennts) {
    // send email
  }
}

Students.enrollStudents()
